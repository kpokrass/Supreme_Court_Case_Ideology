# Classification of Supreme Court Case Opinions by Legal Ideology

## Introduction
The Supreme Court of the United States of America was established in 1789 as the highest federal judiciary. As of 1869, the court is composed of one Chief Justice and eight associate justices. These justices are nominated by the President of the United States and then need to be confirmed by a vote from the Senate in order to serve on the court. Cases brought before the court must pertain to federal/state law or they may concern executive/legislative actions subject to judicial review. Cases are decided by a simple majority of the judicial vote. The Supreme Court will then compose a document known as a "case opinion" explaining what factors lead to the ruling by the justices in the majority vote. A dissenting opinion is usually also composed explaining what factors lead justice's to vote against the majority if the judicial vote is not unanimous.

As cases brought before the Supreme Court are of high importance to the country as a whole and have the ability to affect millions of lives, it is an honor for a legal team to be able to argue a case before the court...and an even bigger honor to have the ruling go in their favor. Thus, it is important for members of the legal team know the legal ideologies of the justices presiding over the court in order to tailor an argument that appeals to that philosophy. There are multiple ways to classify the legal ideology of a justice, but most rely on interpretations of the justice's written works. Therefore, developing a model to analyze the written work of a justice would allow for a fast, automated, and unbiased method for determining their legal ideology and aid development of arguments for legal teams.
